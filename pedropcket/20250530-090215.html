      <h1>My daughter swapped her private school for online learning – the results were remarkable</h1>
      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Traditional schooling caused my daughter to suffer from crippling anxiety, but switching to an independent online school helped her to thrive, offering a personalized alternative to the pressures of traditional education.</p>

      <p>When most people think of online learning and Zoom classes, it’s with a shudder. Those long days of the pandemic, when parents tried to simultaneously do their jobs while also ensuring their offspring didn’t play Minecraft all day, are now, thankfully, a distant memory.</p>
      <p>But online schools are not. According to a 2024 report by the UK Department for Education, the number of students in the UK currently enrolled in <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education-and-careers/2020/08/10/new-online-only-private-school-future-education/?msockid%3D17ee757e4051637214cb608441b16205">full-time online schools</a> has more than tripled since 2020, and that figure looks set to rise further after <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/tax/private-school-tax-raid-what-vat-changes-mean-for-you/?msockid%3D17ee757e4051637214cb608441b16205">Labour removed private schools’ VAT exemption</a>.</p>
      <p>Online and hybrid learning institutions now offer an increasingly viable alternative to traditional schooling. Notably, students with additional needs, those with demanding extracurricular commitments, and <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/jobs/work-benefits/families-quitting-uk-live-abroad-digital-nomads/?msockid%3D17ee757e4051637214cb608441b16205">families living internationally</a> make up a significant portion of this cohort.</p>
      <p>And my daughter is one of them. Last year, Ella, 18, left her private school in the middle of her International Baccalaureate course, having suffered from anxiety and poor mental health.</p>
      <p>She’d always been a more than capable student, but the pressures of traditional schooling – social stress, academic intensity and a rigid daily routine – were beginning to affect her well-being. School had started to feel like a place of dread, not discovery.</p>
      <p>We briefly considered moving her to a local state sixth-form college, but the thought of large class sizes, unfamiliar environments, and the same rigid structure simply didn’t sit right. What she needed was something more personalised.</p>
      <p>We discovered <a href="https://kingsinterhigh.co.uk/">King’s InterHigh</a>, an independent British international online school. Offering primary, secondary and sixth form education, it caters to students aged from seven to 18. It’s one of several online schools operating in the UK, established to offer an alternative option for dissatisfied parents and students (a recent survey carried out by King’s InterHigh, in which 400 parents across the UK were polled, shows 60 per cent are unhappy with current education services).</p>
      <p>Others online schools include Minerva’s Virtual Academy, Wolsey Hall Oxford, and My Online Schooling – each offering slightly different approaches, from tutor-led learning to independent study formats for <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2025/01/16/home-schooling-helps-us-resist-indoctrination-education/?msockid%3D17ee757e4051637214cb608441b16205">homeschoolers</a>. Choosing the right one depends on each child’s learning style, the desired curriculum, and how much parental involvement is feasible day to day.</p>
      <p><strong>How online schooling works</strong></p>
      <p>Initially, of course, we were unsure.</p>
      <p>Would online learning challenge and inspire Ella? Would she miss out on the social development that school is supposed to provide? But the more we researched, the more it seemed a viable alternative to the local state school. With me working from home, she would not be at home alone all day, so we took the plunge.</p>
      <p>Ella is studying the IB Diploma and attends live, timetabled lessons each day, delivered by teachers in real time. Lessons are conducted in small groups, and the digital classroom platform includes features like live chat, screen sharing, quizzes, and breakout rooms for smaller group work. While some content is recorded for catch-up or revision, the focus is on live interaction. Teachers encourage discussion and questions.</p>
      <p>Students typically have the same teacher for each subject, and lessons are structured to mirror a traditional school day but with more flexibility. Homework is set via the online platform and submitted digitally – it might be a written essay or a presentation. Teachers provide detailed feedback through written notes, voice comments, or one-to-one follow-ups. As with any school, there are assessments and mock exams, plus parents’ evenings conducted online.</p>
      <p>When Ella’s feeling anxious, she can step away from class briefly. The constant feedback from teachers makes me feel more (rather than less) involved; post-primary, you do end up feeling more removed from the kids’ schooling, but now I can help her catch up with missed classes.</p>
      <p><strong>Who suits online learning</strong></p>
      <p>We found that for someone like Ella, who had been struggling with anxiety, online learning took the pressure off (as many kids found in the pandemic, too). It’s also good for self-driven learners, families who travel or live abroad, or athletes and performers.</p>
      <p>Ella’s fellow students include Maxwell Whitelock, who played Alfie in the recent Channel 4 <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/tv/0/patience-channel-4-review-ella-maisy-purvis/?msockid%3D17ee757e4051637214cb608441b16205">crime drama <em>Patience</em></a>, who found that traditional schooling couldn’t meet his needs. “I wasn’t doing very well in normal school because I’d always come home sad or angry,” Maxwell says. On top of the emotional toll, his mother, Emma, says Maxwell also faced negative comments about being autistic.</p>
      <p>Lillia Turner, star of <em>EastEnders</em> and winner of Favourite Young Actor (Under 18) at the TV Times Awards 2024, is another student whose demanding acting schedule now fits seamlessly around her studies. Meanwhile, Kyle Babbage, an aspiring tennis athlete working toward professional status, has been able to fit studies around his rigorous training and travel schedule thanks to online schooling – something traditional school attendance would have made impossible.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, online school might not suit children who need high physical energy outlets or thrive on in-person interaction, or who struggle with self-discipline without in-person supervision. Some teens love daily sports or clubs, and would miss that in an online setting.</p>
      <p><strong>Making friends</strong></p>
      <p>The biggest question for me was whether Ella would feel isolated and not able to make friends. To encourage kids to communicate with each other, the school offers virtual assemblies and clubs, plus there’s a traditional public school-style house system.</p>
      <p>“Students are allocated a house and invited to join clubs and societies spanning everything from chess to technology, sculpting, and debate,” says a member of the pastoral team. “It’s about creating a sense of belonging – even in a digital space.”</p>
      <p>And yes, they meet in real life, too, typically at festivals or competitions.</p>
      <p><strong>Are online schools accredited?</strong></p>
      <p>In 2023, the UK government launched the Online Education Accreditation Scheme (OEAS) to ensure consistent standards across virtual schools. Run by <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/ofsted/?msockid%3D17ee757e4051637214cb608441b16205">Ofsted</a>, it is designed to provide formal recognition and accountability for online education providers.</p>
      <p>King’s InterHigh has applied to the OEAS and is currently awaiting its Ofsted inspection. Critics have noted that the rollout has been slow, and some schools have opted out altogether due to concerns over regulatory fit. Others, like Minerva’s Virtual Academy and Academy21, have already begun the process. The accreditation, once achieved, ensures that a school meets the same safeguarding, quality of education, and leadership standards expected in physical schools.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, King’s InterHigh has become a Cambridge International School. The accreditation process involves a detailed assessment of a school’s mission, leadership, teaching quality and student-support systems.</p>
      <p>The biggest question for parents is whether qualifications will be accepted by <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education-and-careers/schools-students-places-russell-group-university-best-my-area/?msockid%3D17ee757e4051637214cb608441b16205">Russell Group universities</a> or <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/news/2025/03/30/admissions-guru-ivy-league-college/?msockid%3D17ee757e4051637214cb608441b16205">Ivy League schools</a>. Yet, 80 per cent of King’s students secured their first-place offer last year.</p>
      <p>As for the fees, it obviously pricier than state, but cheaper than an average private school. Primary, GCSE and A-level tuition at King’s InterHigh ranges from £3,000 to £6,000 per year, depending on the number of subjects and level of study, and rises to around £10,000 a year for the IB Diploma. Wolsey Hall Oxford offers a variety of options, with A-levels costing approximately £1,800 per course.</p>
      <p><strong>A calm and confident student</strong></p>
      <p>A year ago, we were really worried that Ella wouldn’t be able to continue with her diploma at all. But now that she’s grown in confidence and rediscovered her love for learning, she is mentally prepared for this term’s exams.</p>
      <p>There have also been som unexpected family benefits, too. Having Ella at home has reshaped our routine. Mornings are less chaotic (no school run) and lunches are often shared, which has unexpectedly brought us closer. I work from the kitchen while she studies in the next room. We take breaks at similar times, and I’ve found we talk more than we did when she was out the door by 7:30am. It’s a less fragmented, more connected day for us both.</p>
      <p>“When students join King’s InterHigh, they don’t just join a school – they join a community,” says Catriona Olsen, Executive Head. “We want every learner to feel seen, supported and celebrated for who they are.”</p>
      <p>That’s what we’ve found: Ella is thriving, and, as a parent, the transformation has been heartening.</p>
      <p><strong>How to boost a state education with out-of-hours activities</strong></p>
      <p>However, full-time online schooling isn’t for everyone. And as private school fees continue to rise, many families are making the decision to switch to state, writes Sybilla Hart.</p>
      <p>Undeniably, as good as some UK state schools are, they may not have the sparkling extra-curricular facilities that private schools offer such as art, languages, sport and drama, which are included in the cost of the school day.</p>
      <p>But whether your kids have always been at state or grammar, or are moving over because of VAT rises, there are many ways to boost their extra-curricular education and their CV to boot, whether that’s through sport, top-up online classes or in-person tutoring.</p>
      <p><strong>Tutoring</strong></p>
      <p>Many tutorial colleges offer summer revision courses so that kids can hit the ground running when they start back in September. The Association of Independent Sixth-Form Colleges (<a href="http://cife.org.uk">cife.org.uk</a>) is a good place to start looking.</p>
      <p>Justin Craig Education offers Easter, May and summer revision courses for most subjects at GCSE and A level at its eight centres, including Hertfordshire and London. Fees start at around £240 for a one-day, one-subject course. Summer residential courses cost £1,475.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://oxfordtutors.com/">Oxford Tutors</a> offers a complimentary series of Maths workshops (also free to download), and provide one-to-one tutoring for students in all subjects, from £50 per hour.</p>
      <p><strong>Sport</strong></p>
      <p>Flashy facilities are not only the preserve of private schools – you’ll be surprised what’s on offer in your locality – but if you do live close to one of Britain’s top public schools, remember that they often share access to swimming pools, tennis courts and cricket pitches.</p>
      <p><strong>Rowing:</strong> If you live near a river, you’ll likely <a href="https://www.britishrowing.org/rowing-activity-finder/">live near</a> a rowing club that runs a structured junior competition programme. Although race fees can add up, most clubs offer financial assistance to disadvantaged junior rowers. For example, Ross Rowing Club in Ross-on-Wye recruits children from ages 12-18 for its junior club and holds holiday training camps, usually during the Easter and summer holidays.</p>
      <p><strong>Cricket:</strong> Cricket is not just the preserve of the costly preparatory school. Lots of regional cricket clubs offer after-school classes to primary-school age children for free. Visit <a href="https://www.allstarscricket.co.uk/">allstarscricket.co.uk</a> and use the session finder to find multiple centres in your local area. From there you can follow the registration links and pay online. All Stars is suitable for children aged 5-8 and Dynamo Cricket is for children ages 8-11. The cost of a term’s tuition at cricket clubs typically starts at £50 per child for eight sessions, which includes a personalised training top and bag.</p>
      <p><strong>Riding:</strong> Learning to ride is a great skill but it also teaches kids how to look after animals and to muck out a stable. Lots of riding schools run after-school and weekend classes – and you definitely don’t need your own pony to learn to ride. British Equestrian has a <a href="https://www.britishequestrian.org.uk/getInvolved/participation/where-to-ride">postcode search tool</a> that will help you to find your local riding school or pony club.</p>
      <p><strong>Art courses</strong></p>
      <p>One area where it is hard for state schools to compete is in art school provision. While private schools have pottery studios and printing presses, comprehensives may be lucky to get a dedicated space with natural light.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.art-k.co.uk/">Art K</a> offers classes around the country for primary and secondary students. Meanwhile, for history of art lessons suitable for teens look no further than <a href="https://www.kristinetghardeberg.no/">Kristine T G Hardeberg</a>. She holds online courses that cost £200 (a reduced rate for under 18s only) on subjects such as The Baroque, The Renaissance and Impressionism. She also offers lectures from £19.</p>
      <p><strong>Cookery Lessons</strong></p>
      <p>Cook Stars runs weekly lessons for two-17 year olds nationwide, from Brighton to Bridgend and Stockport to Salisbury. The first trial class is free and the course costs £78 per half term (six sessions). Children will learn to cook basic dishes and cakes such as soda bread, mini pizzas, bacon and spinach parcels, and red velvet cupcakes.</p>
      <p><strong>Drama and Dance</strong></p>
      <p><a href="https://www.stagecoach.co.uk/">Stagecoach</a> is a regional company that offers after school drama classes as well as holiday courses that culminate in a production such as <em>Matilda</em> or <em>Shrek.</em> The 12-week termly classes typically cost £360 for a weekly three-hour lesson. The holiday courses cost around £170. <a href="https://theatretrain.co.uk/">Theatretrain</a> also offers dancing, acting and singing classes in 70 locations costing around £25 each for children aged between six-18.</p>
      <p>The Royal Academy of Dance is offering a Children’s Summer Camp from July 28 to August 1 this year for children aged four to seven in London, costing £133 per week (10 per cent sibling discount) as well as summer courses for more experienced dancers. Book by June 9. Contact <a href="mailto:participate%40rad.org.uk">participate@rad.org.uk</a></p>
      <p><strong>Forest School Camps</strong></p>
      <p><a href="https://www.fsc.org.uk/">Forest School Camps</a> is a charity that runs school-holiday camps for children. Its aim is “to provide opportunities for children from all backgrounds to experience living on the land under canvas and to encourage individual resilience and self-reliance.”</p>
      <p>Mobile phone use is banned, and cooking is done on wood fires; it’s real back-to-basics stuff but lifelong friendships are formed and many child campers return to volunteer as adults.</p>
