      <p>Apple is going to change how it names its next set of major operating systems, <em>Bloomberg</em> reports. Instead of just notching up the version number, Apple will instead mark them by year.</p>
      <p>However, the numbers will apparently align with the year <em>after</em> the one the update is actually released in, similar to cars. That means that the next big iOS update will be iOS 26 instead of iOS 19. <em>Bloomberg</em> says that other upcoming name changes include iPadOS 26, macOS 26, watchOS 26, tvOS 26, and visionOS 26.</p>
      <p>Apple plans to officially announce the change at its Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC), which kicks off on June 9th. The idea is to make Apple’s software version numbers more consistent. Right now, the version numbers are all over the place; the current naming schemes include things like iOS 18, watchOS 12, and visionOS 2.</p>
      <p>At WWDC, Apple is also expected to show off a design overhaul of its operating systems that’s inspired by the Vision Pro’s visionOS. The event begins with a keynote on June 9th at 1PM ET.</p>
