      <h1>What I’ve learned from teaching philosophy in prisons</h1>
      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Teaching philosophy in prisons might seem an unusual choice, given the educational challenges and common perception of prisons as purely punitive. However, the author's three years of experience demonstrate that such courses offer profound benefits beyond traditional education. Philosophy, uniquely suited for conversational learning without needing textbooks or technology, significantly impacts prisoners' lives and the overall prison environment.</p>
      <p>These courses provide a rare opportunity for inmates to engage in constructive dialogue, challenging rigid norms and fostering positive disagreement. This is particularly crucial in often overcrowded and dangerous prison settings, where conflict can easily arise. Philosophy's inherently open-ended questions encourage critical thinking and active listening, leading to improved confidence and a re-evaluation of what education might mean for them.</p>
      <p>Ultimately, philosophical education in prisons has been shown to improve mental health and wellbeing among participants. It fosters greater understanding among inmates, potentially transforming prison culture and contributing to a reduction in reoffending, all at a relatively low cost.</p>

      <p>Of all the subjects that could be taught in prisons, philosophy might seem a strange choice. You might think that we should address the educational basics first, since, according to a House of Commons report, 57% of prisoners in England “have English and Maths levels at or below those expected of an eleven-year-old”. You might also expect prison education to focus on the skills needed for employment after release.</p>
      <p>In the UK, many people think that prisons should harshly punish offenders, and perhaps see philosophy courses as an unjustifiable luxury for those who have broken the law.</p>
      <p>However, we are in a period of potentially significant change for the UK prison system, which has been overcrowded and in poor condition for years.</p>
      <p>In my three years of running philosophy courses in prisons, I have witnessed what can be achieved with this kind of education. I have found that philosophy courses can make a big difference to the lives of prisoners and prison culture, often in unexpected ways.</p>
      <p>Working with colleagues at the charity Philosophy in Prison and the University of Sheffield, I have led philosophy courses in several English prisons, and found that philosophy is particularly well-suited to prison education. Unlike most topics, philosophy can be taught purely in conversation, without textbooks or technology.</p>
      <hr />
      <p>There are many good reasons for engaging in philosophical conversations with people in prison. Conversations allow almost anyone to get involved, regardless of their levels of literacy. Philosophical conversations can give male prisoners a rare opportunity to relax the rigid norms of masculinity that prisons implicitly enforce. </p>
      <p>But one of the biggest benefits I have seen is the effects of these conversations on people’s attitudes towards disagreement. Prisons are overcrowded and often dangerous places, where disagreement can all too easily lead to conflict. Fortunately, philosophy provides an excellent opportunity for constructive dialogue.</p>
      <h2>Getting philosophical</h2>
      <p>One of the most intriguing things about philosophy is that nobody knows the answers to the questions it asks of us. Think about questions like, “what makes you the same person you were ten years ago?”, “what is a good life?” or “what is knowledge?”</p>
      <p>Such questions get to the heart of what it is to be human, and they have puzzled people for centuries. They require everyone, from the most experienced philosopher to the complete newcomer, to question why we think as we do. They also sharpen our interest in what others have to say.</p>
      <p>Take the first of these questions, for example. Perhaps you think that your memories of your past make you the same person that you used to be. But we cannot remember being asleep, and we are presumably not different people when we sleep. So, you might suggest instead, we had the same bodies ten years ago. Except that every part of a human body changes over time – over ten years, every cell in our bodies might be replaced. Now, with just four sentences, the puzzle has been set, and a conversation begun.</p>
      <p>Many of the questions we discuss in prison courses originally come from the world of classical philosophy (such as the three mentioned above). And our conversations often explore the ideas of ancient and historical philosophers – whether Aristotle or Bentham has a better understanding of the good life, for example.</p>
      <p>Britain’s prisons are facing overcrowding and poor conditions, which has led the government to release more prisoners early.</p>
      <p>In any philosophical conversation, we will quickly realise that disagreement need not involve confrontation: it can be progressive, exciting, even fun. Philosophy helps people develop and practice the conversational norms – and the confidence – needed for positive disagreement. In my experience, prisoners often enter philosophy courses with little expectation that they will have anything to contribute. </p>
      <p>Many prisoners “have limited or negative experiences of education and therefore a limited belief in the potential of learning”. But philosophy courses can radically improve people’s confidence, and so help them to rethink what education might mean for them. </p>
      <p>One of our course participants summarised this point as follows: “With philosophy, people care about what I think. Nobody listens when you’ve been in prison. Everything you think is wrong, rubbish, you’re nothing.” Another was even more direct: “Hated school, dropped out at 11, can’t read, can’t write. But I can do this.”</p>
      <h2>Transforming prison culture</h2>
      <p>Evidence shows that participation in education can significantly reduce the likelihood of reoffending. Yet, as the recent Independent Sentencing Review highlights, the rise in the UK prison population has led to finite resources being diverted away from such programmes. </p>
      <p>Philosophy courses can facilitate transformations in prison culture, at relatively little cost. An inspection report into one of the prisons that I have worked in for several years noted that prisoners who took the philosophy courses “reported that their mental health and wellbeing had improved and that they enjoyed the opportunity to participate”. </p>
      <p>Moreover, I have seen philosophy courses influence a whole prison wing, as people continued their conversations after we left. One participant said that “being in a room with inmates I didn’t know but ended up talking to went a long way to understanding each other… I now talk to more people on the wing”.</p>
      <p>No matter what prisoners may have done, they share in our common humanity. By engaging in philosophy with prisoners, we can address this with very positive results – potentially both in and after prison.</p>
