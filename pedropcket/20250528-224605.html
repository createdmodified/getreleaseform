      <p>A documentary chronicling the origins of rave culture and the UK’s free party movement will make its worldwide virtual premiere this Friday (30th May).</p>
      <p>The work of filmmaker Aaron Trinder, <em>Free Party: A Folk History</em> commemorates the 33rd anniversary of the <a href="//djmag.com/features/castlemorton-1992-photographing-illegal-rave-changed-uk-dance-music-forever">legendary week-long Castlemorton rave</a> and 40 years since the 1985 <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/jan/15/battle-of-the-beanfield-stonehenge-1985-rose-brash-photograph" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer external nofollow">Battle of the Beanfield</a>, when around 1,300 officers from Wiltshire Police launched at approximately 600 new age travellers with truncheons to prevent them setting up the Stonehenge Free Festival, which resulted in dozens of injuries, including women and children. </p>
      <p>Bound together by an era-defining soundtrack, these pivotal events are crucial to the film’s narrative, which places the radical, counter-cultural free party movement within its socio-political context: the Public Order Act 1986, Margaret Thatcher’s last days in power and the subsequent legal changes and crackdowns that followed in the wake of the <a href="//djmag.com/news/play-inspired-1992-rave-castlemorton-debuts-summer">1992 Castlemorton rave</a>.</p>
      <p>Composed of news clips, “never-before-seen” archival footage and first-hand accounts from key free party collectives such as West London-originating <a href="//djmag.com/features/history-spiral-tribe-uks-most-notorious-travelling-sound-system">Spiral Tribe</a>, Circus Warp, and Nottingham’s <a href="//djmag.com/features/how-diy-sound-system-blazed-trail-90s-free-party-movement">DiY Sound System</a>, as well as DJs and other contributors, <em>Free Party: A Folk History</em> builds a timeline from the peak of acid house in 1989 and the explosion of free parties in 1991 through to the large-scale protests against the arrival of the <a href="//djmag.com/features/dance-protest-30-years-uks-anti-rave-criminal-justice-bill">anti-rave Criminal Justice Bill</a> in 1994. The film later delves into the European teknival scene before zipping forward to the present day.</p>
      <p>Notably, <em>Free Party: A Folk History</em> celebrates the catalytic coming together of the new age traveller community and the urban ravers at Glastonbury’s erstwhile travellers' field in 1990, a meeting that filmmaker Aaron Trinder describes as a “kind of marriage made in some sort of glorious rave heaven”. </p>
      <p>Initially envisioned as a short film documenting Spiral Tribe’s infamous week-long ‘90/‘91 New Year’s party at Camden’s then-abandoned Roundhouse — of which Trinder was an attendee — it struck him that no one had yet captured the whole story of the free party movement. “One interview led to another. And I just found myself with enough material, entering lockdown to sort of shape a film,” he told DJ Mag.</p>
      <p>“It’s the insider's perspective. If someone had a camera, you often thought it was undercover police. So the way you could get away with having a camera really was that you had to be part of the scene... They were all ravers with an idea of documenting this thing that was happening around them."</p>
      <p>After getting off to a slow start, largely owing to a lack of visual footage from the time (“Nobody had a camera back then”), Trinder had designs on making a radio play or a podcast. However, archival treasures soon began trickling in, appearing both from official sources as well as “unofficial and private sources”. The film was soon underway.</p>
      <p>“It’s all kind of incredible,” he said of the archive. “Because generally it's the insider's perspective. If someone had a camera, you often thought it was undercover police. So the way you could get away with having a camera really was that you had to be part of the scene.” </p>
      <p>A huge number of contributors began sharing their photographs and video footage with Trinder, some of it shot on video cameras or Super 8. “They were all ravers with an idea of documenting this thing that was happening around them,” he said. </p>
      <p>Among the archive filmmakers involved in <em>Free Party: A Folk History</em> were Gareth Morris, Andrew Gaston, Sara Sender and Justin Potter-Daniels. Potter-Daniels borrowed a camera from his West Country college because he was doing a film and media course, Trinder recalled. </p>
      <p>“I owe a huge debt to the people who actually had a camera back then,” gushed Trinder, adding that he has since become close collaborators with several of the contributors involved in the documentary. “I knew that all of the material would be very varied in terms of quality and format. I discovered every weird tape format under the sun: VHS-C, S-VHS, DV, MiniDV...” </p>
      <p>Trinder said he was also given flyers, stickers and other memorabilia to use. “The whole look and feel of that era was extremely cut and paste. So we just went with that as a style.” All of the interviews and a lot of the “contemporary stuff” was then shot at festivals and protests on a modern camera.</p>
      <p>“I hope I've shown in the film that the drive to do this is so old, that we'll always want to do it. Everybody will always want to dance under the stars and meet people and get rid of our judgments and unify in some way.”</p>
      <p>Interview-wise, Trinder spoke to an array of people for the documentary, including legendary DiY Sound System founding member and Adonis resident DJ Grace Sands and Bedlam sound system co-founder <a href="//djmag.com/features/free-parties-feeding-vulnerable-how-90s-rave-organiser-switched-sound-systems-community">Steve Stavrinides</a>. The “depth of the traveller story” proved to be one of the most illuminating aspects of the process for Trinder. “When I started making the short film idea, I didn't know how important and pivotal that was going to be to the film,” he remarked.</p>
      <p>“In a way, the way I've structured the film almost mirrors that. As in, I start with the ravers, and the ravers then discover the travellers at Glastonbury 1990, and then we go back. And that was almost a little bit like my journey: I was a raver, I knew about the travellers a little bit, but then in the process of making the film, I got much more depth, and an understanding about what that story was because of the people I interviewed.”</p>
      <p>It goes on to highlight the demonisation of the new age traveller community by the UK government, and the “kind of fallout” after the Battle of the Beanfield. “And then this little brief foray back into a blossoming again with the rave scene,” returning to the euphoric meeting of minds at Glastonbury’s free field. The film ends by locating itself in the present day.</p>
      <p>“It's definitely gone full circle,” reflected Trinder on current appetites for raving and free parties. “A lot of young people have come up to me after the film and said, ‘Oh, when are you going to do part two?’ And I'm like, ‘No, this has taken seven years. I don't think I've got the energy to do a whole thing. But you make the film’.”</p>
      <p>He concluded: “I hope I've shown in the film that the drive to do this is so old, that we'll always want to do it. Everybody will always want to dance under the stars and meet people and get rid of our judgments and unify in some way.”</p>
      <p>The online premiere of <em>Free Party: A Folk History</em> takes place this Friday 30th May. The virtual event will include a livestream of the film — starting at 7pm in most time zones — followed by 'bonus features' including a mini doc with Jeremy Deller, a film with counter culture photographer Alan "Tash" Lodge, and a Q&A with Spiral Tribe, DiY, Bedlam and more.
